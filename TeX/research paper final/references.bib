   abstract = {In this paper, the preemptive resource constrained project scheduling problem with set up times is investigated. In this problem, a fixed setup time is required to restart when an process is preempted. The project contains activities inter-related by finish to start type precedence relations with a time lag of zero, which require a set of renewable resources. The problem formed in this way is an NP-hard. A mixed integer programming model is proposed for the problem and a parameters tuned meta-heuristic namely genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it. To evaluate the validation and performance of the proposed algorithm a set of 100 test problems is used. Comparative statistical results show that the proposed algorithm is efficiently capable to solve the problem.},

   abstract = {The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Project (RCPSP), together with some of its extensions, has been widely studied. A fundamental assumption in this basic problem is that activities in progress are non-preemptable. Very little effort has been made to uncover the potential benefits of discrete activity pre-emption, and the papers dealing with this issue have reached the conclusion that it has little effect on project length when constant resource availability levels are defined. In this paper we show how three basic elements of many heuristics for the RCPSP – codification, serial SGS and double justification – can be adapted to deal with interruption. The paper is mainly focussed on problem 1_PRCPSP, a generalization of the RCPSP where a maximum of one interruption per activity is allowed. However, it is also shown how these three elements can be further adapted to deal with more general pre-emptive problems. Computational experiments on the standard j30 and j120 sets support the conclusion that pre-emption does help to decrease project length when compared to the no-interruption case. They also prove the usefulness of the justification in the presence of pre-emption. The justification is a RCPS technique that can be easily incorporated into a wide range of algorithms for the RCPSP, increasing their solution quality – maintaining the number of schedules calculated.},

Many different approaches, such as mathematical programming, heuristics, simulating annealing, etc., have been presented to solve this class of intractable problems. In our approach we consider a graph-theoretical method based on new coloring techniques. In particular, given a disjunctive graph we examine the correspondences between an assignment of time windows (i.e. activities starting time and finishing time) and an assignment of colors to the activities of a project, defining when an exact weighted coloring is an optimal preemptive schedule. We present computational results on randomly generated test problems of the branch and bound algorithm proposed. From the results obtained emerges that the possibility to manage hard problems using new coloring techniques seems to be more efficient than others, referring in particular to the performances of the algorithm proposed.},

   abstract = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time–cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations.},

All resources considered are renewable and each resource unit may not be available at all times due to resource vacations, which are known in advance, and assignment to other finite duration activities. A designed experiment is conducted that investigates project makespan improvement when activity splitting is permitted in various project scenarios, where different project scenarios are defined by parameters that have been used in the research literature. A branch-and-bound procedure is applied to solve a number of small project scheduling problems with and without activity splitting. The results show that, in the presence of resource vacations and temporary resource unavailability, activity splitting can significantly improve the optimal project makespan in many scenarios, and that the makespan improvement is primarily dependent on those parameters that impact resource utilization.},

   abstract = {This paper reports on a new solution approach for the well-known multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP). This problem type aims at the selection of a single activity mode from a set of available modes in order to construct a precedence and a (renewable and non-renewable) resource feasible project schedule with a minimal makespan. The problem type is known to be NP-hard and has been solved using various exact as well as (meta-)heuristic procedures. The new algorithm splits the problem type into a mode assignment and a single mode project scheduling step. The mode assignment step is solved by a satisfiability (SAT) problem solver and returns a feasible mode selection to the project scheduling step. The project scheduling step is solved using an efficient meta-heuristic procedure from literature to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). However, unlike many traditional meta-heuristic methods in literature to solve the MRCPSP, the new approach executes these two steps in one run, relying on a single priority list. Straightforward adaptations to the pure SAT solver by using pseudo boolean non-renewable resource constraints has led to a high quality solution approach in a reasonable computational time. Computational results show that the procedure can report similar or sometimes even better solutions than found by other procedures in literature, although it often requires a higher CPU time.},

In particular, conditions are given that allow a solution of the linear program to be a feasible schedule. From these properties, an algorithm based on neighbourhood search is derived. One neighbour solution is obtained through one Simplex pivoting, if this pivoting preserves feasibility. Methods to get out of local minima are provided.

Our solver is lightweight and shows good performance both in finding feasible solutions and in proving lower bounds. Our numerical tests allowed us to close several benchmark instances of the RCPSP that have never been closed before by proving tighter lower bounds and by finding better feasible solutions. Using our method we solve optimally more instances of medium and large size from the benchmark library PSPLIB and do it faster compared to any other existing solver.},

   abstract = {The issue of how to generate problem instances of controlled difficulty is addressed. Precedence- and resource-constrained (project) scheduling problems are focused on, but similar ideas may be applied to other network optimization problems. A network construction procedure is described that takes into account: 1. constraints on the network topology, 2. a resource factor that reflects the density of the coefficient matrix, and 3. a resource strength, which measures the availability of resources. The strong impact of the chosen parametric characterization of the problems is shown via an in depth computational study. Instances for the single- and multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem are benchmarked by using the state of the art (branch and bound) procedures. The results provided demonstrate that the classical benchmark instances used by several researchers over decades belong to the subset of the very easy ones. In addition, it is shown that hard instances, being far smaller in size than presumed in the literature, may not be solved to optimality even within a large amount of computation time.},

A new category of setup times - schedule-dependent ones - is discussed.

   abstract = {Most of the real life scheduling problems include several constraints in addition to the precedence and resource constraints considered in the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we define a generalization of the (RCPSP) with a wide class of additional constraints, including (but not limited to): a pair of activities must be separated by at least a given duration; a subset of activities cannot be processed simultaneously; an activity cannot start before a particular period; an activity cannot be scheduled in a particular time window; there are resource constraints with varying required and available quantities. We show that for this generalization the activity list and the activity set list representations can be used as efficiently as in the (RCPSP) and that by using these representations the optimal solution can always be reached. This allows most of the known solution procedures for (RCPSP) based on these representations to be extended for the generalized (RCPSP) by simply replacing the classical decoding procedure used for the (RCPSP) with the generalized version introduced here.},

   abstract = {The resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) has a wide variety of practical applications in construction, manufacturing, project planning, and other areas. Since the 1960s many optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve this NP-hard problem, and their performances are evaluated in well-known test problems with different complexities. Although it is desirable to find an algorithm which can provide promising solutions with reasonable computational efforts for any problem under consideration, no single algorithm can meet that condition. To deal with this challenge, we present a genetic algorithm based memetic algorithm (MA) for solving RCPSP. The algorithm is initiated by a critical path-based heuristic and a variant of the Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (NEH) heuristic. The algorithm involves a similar block order crossover and a variable insertion based local search. An automatic restart scheme is also presented which assists the algorithm to escape from local optima. In addition, a design-of-experiment (DOE) method is used to determine the set of suitable parameters for the proposed MA. Numerical results, statistical analysis and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

   abstract = {Over the last decade, many metaheuristics have been applied to the flowshop scheduling problem, ranging from Simulated Annealing or Tabu Search to complex hybrid techniques. Some of these methods provide excellent effectiveness and efficiency at the expense of being utterly complicated. In fact, several published methods require substantial implementation efforts, exploit problem specific speed-up techniques that cannot be applied to slight variations of the original problem, and often re-implementations of these methods by other researchers produce results that are quite different from the original ones. In this work we present a new iterated greedy algorithm that applies two phases iteratively, named destruction, were some jobs are eliminated from the incumbent solution, and construction, where the eliminated jobs are reinserted into the sequence using the well known NEH construction heuristic. Optionally, a local search can be applied after the construction phase. Our iterated greedy algorithm is both very simple to implement and, as shown by experimental results, highly effective when compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

A random generator of project networks is used as well as a model to produce graphical representations of the network. Major results are presented showing how sensitive are the parameters of the distribution of the total duration to the morphology of the network, allowing the project manager to estimate the risk of delay in terms of the proposed indicators. Thus, these results can be used as a decision aid to select alternative designs for the project network taking into account the correspondent risk of delay.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new solution algorithm to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with activity splitting and setup times. The option of splitting activities, known as activity preemption, has been studied in literature from various angles, and an overview of the main contributions will be given. The solution algorithm makes use of a meta-heuristic search for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) using network transformations to split activities in subparts. More precisely, the project network is split up such that all possible preemptive parts are incorporated into an extended network as so-called activity segments, and setup times are incorporated between the different activity segments. Due to the inherent complexity to solve the problem for such huge project networks, a solution approach is proposed that selects the appropriate activity segments and ignores the remaining segments using a boolean satisfiability problem solver, and afterwards schedules these projects to near-optimality with the renewable resource constraints. The algorithm has been tested using a large computational experiment with five types of setup times. Moreover, an extension to the problem with overlaps between preemptive parts of activities has been proposed and it is shown that our algorithm can easily cope with this extension without changing it. Computational experiments show that activity preemption sometimes leads to makespan reductions without requiring a lot of splits in the activities. Moreover, is shown that the degree of these makespan reductions depends on the network and resource indicators of the project instance.},

We review six topological network indicators in order to describe the detailed structure of a project network. These indicators were originally developed by [L.V. Tavares, J.A. Ferreira and J.S. Coelho, The risk of delay of a project in terms of the morphology of its network, European Journal of Operational Research 119 (1999), 510–537] and have been modified, or sometimes completely replaced, by alternative indicators to describe the network topology. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we generate a large amount of different networks with four project network generators. Our general conclusions are that none of the network generators are able to capture the complete feasible domain of all networks. Additionally, each network generator covers its own network-specific domain and, consequently, contributes to the generation of data sets. Secondly, we perform computational results on the well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem to prove that our indicators are reliable and have significant, predictive power to serve as complexity indicators.},
