\section{Some further guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item Read the manual for the Research Project. (See e.g.\ the instructions on the maximum length: less is more!)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reference use}
\begin{itemize}
\item use a system for generating the bibliographic information automatically from your database, e.g., use BibTex and/or Mendeley, EndNote, Papers, or \ldots
\item all ideas, fragments, figures and data that have been quoted from other work have correct references
\item literal quotations have quotation marks and page numbers
\item paraphrases are not too close to the original
\item the references and bibliography meet the requirements
\item every reference in the text corresponds to an item in the bibliography and vice versa
\item our own preference would be to use IEEE reference style (check with supervisor)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structure}
Paragraphs
\begin{itemize}
\item are well-constructed
\item are not too long: each paragraph discusses one topic
\item start with clear topic sentences
\item are divided into a clear paragraph structure
\item there is a clear line of argumentation from research question to conclusions
\item scientific literature is reviewed critically
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Style}
\begin{itemize}
\item correct use of English: understandable, no spelling errors, acceptable grammar, no lexical mistakes 
\item use of British or American English: pick one individually and use it consistently
\item the style used is objective
\item clarity: sentences are not too complicated (not too long), there is no ambiguity
\item attractiveness: sentence length is varied, active voice and passive voice are mixed
\item the author refers to themselves as "we"
\item refrain from using "we" as much as possible in all sections except abstract and conclusion
\item single-column or double-column format: you can pick your own preference (no strict rule)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tables and figures}
\begin{itemize}
\item all have a number and a caption
\item all are referred to at least once in the text
\item all are numbered consecutively in the same order as their appearance in the text.
\item if copied, they contain a reference
\item can be interpreted on their own (e.g. by means of a legend)
\item tables should be provided as editable text, not as images.
\item tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peer review}
\begin{itemize}
\item Peers provide feedback to each other by adding notes to their papers. This feedback can range from small errors to structural improvements to sections. 
\item A summary of the feedback should be given by filling in the rubric (where applicable).
\item Reviews should be done in week 4.7 on first draft version of the paper.
\end{itemize}
