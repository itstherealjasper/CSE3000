\section{Responsible Research}
Reflect on the ethical aspects of your research and discuss the reproducibility of your methods.
Note that although in many published works there is no such a section (it may be part of some meta-information collected by the journal, or part of the discussion section), we require you to think (and report) about this as part of this course.

Main topic is the correct way to compare algorithm results. They should all be written by programmers of equal skill and be run on the same system.

Also discuss the importance of making source code publicly available, to make it easier for your work to be reviewed and to improve reproducibility.
