   abstract = {The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Project (RCPSP), together with some of its extensions, has been widely studied. A fundamental assumption in this basic problem is that activities in progress are non-preemptable. Very little effort has been made to uncover the potential benefits of discrete activity pre-emption, and the papers dealing with this issue have reached the conclusion that it has little effect on project length when constant resource availability levels are defined. In this paper we show how three basic elements of many heuristics for the RCPSP – codification, serial SGS and double justification – can be adapted to deal with interruption. The paper is mainly focussed on problem 1_PRCPSP, a generalization of the RCPSP where a maximum of one interruption per activity is allowed. However, it is also shown how these three elements can be further adapted to deal with more general pre-emptive problems. Computational experiments on the standard j30 and j120 sets support the conclusion that pre-emption does help to decrease project length when compared to the no-interruption case. They also prove the usefulness of the justification in the presence of pre-emption. The justification is a RCPS technique that can be easily incorporated into a wide range of algorithms for the RCPSP, increasing their solution quality – maintaining the number of schedules calculated.},

   abstract = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time–cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations.},

   abstract = {This paper reports on a new solution approach for the well-known multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP). This problem type aims at the selection of a single activity mode from a set of available modes in order to construct a precedence and a (renewable and non-renewable) resource feasible project schedule with a minimal makespan. The problem type is known to be NP-hard and has been solved using various exact as well as (meta-)heuristic procedures. The new algorithm splits the problem type into a mode assignment and a single mode project scheduling step. The mode assignment step is solved by a satisfiability (SAT) problem solver and returns a feasible mode selection to the project scheduling step. The project scheduling step is solved using an efficient meta-heuristic procedure from literature to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). However, unlike many traditional meta-heuristic methods in literature to solve the MRCPSP, the new approach executes these two steps in one run, relying on a single priority list. Straightforward adaptations to the pure SAT solver by using pseudo boolean non-renewable resource constraints has led to a high quality solution approach in a reasonable computational time. Computational results show that the procedure can report similar or sometimes even better solutions than found by other procedures in literature, although it often requires a higher CPU time.},

However, due to its strongly NP-hard status, the effectiveness of exact optimisation procedures is restricted to relatively small instances. In this paper, we present a new genetic algorithm (GA) for this problem that is able to provide near-optimal heuristic solutions. This GA procedure has been extended by a so-called decomposition-based genetic algorithm (DBGA) that iteratively solves subparts of the project. We present computational experiments on two data sets. The first benchmark set is used to illustrate the performance of both the GA and the DBGA. The second set is used to compare the results with current state-of-the-art heuristics and to show that the procedure is capable of producing consistently good results for challenging problem instances. We illustrate that the GA outperforms all state-of-the-art heuristics and that the DBGA further improves the performance of the GA.]},

   abstract = {The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) consists of activities that must be scheduled subject to precedence and resource constraints such that the makespan is minimized. It has become a well-known standard problem in the context of project scheduling which has attracted numerous researchers who developed both exact and heuristic scheduling procedures. However, it is a rather basic model with assumptions that are too restrictive for many practical applications. Consequently, various extensions of the basic RCPSP have been developed. This paper gives an overview over these extensions. The extensions are classified according to the structure of the RCPSP. We summarize generalizations of the activity concept, of the precedence relations and of the resource constraints. Alternative objectives and approaches for scheduling multiple projects are discussed as well. In addition to popular variants and extensions such as multiple modes, minimal and maximal time lags, and net present value-based objectives, the paper also provides a survey of many less known concepts.},

The resources and tasks may take many forms. In project scheduling the tasks refer to the activities belonging to one or more projects. The execution of project activities may require the use of different types of resources (money, crews, equipment, …). The scheduling objectives may also take many forms (minimizing project duration, minimizing project costs, maximizing project revenues, optimizing due date performance,…). The result is a wide and steadily growing variety of problem types which motivates the introduction of a systematic notation that can serve as a basis for a classification scheme.},

In the current paper, we extend this pre-emptive scheduling problem with setup times between activity interruptions and the possibility to schedule pre-emptive sub-parts of activities in parallel. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we briefly show that an efficient exact branch-and-bound procedure from the literature to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem can be easily adapted to cope with our problem extensions. Second, we extensively test the impact of these pre-emptive extensions to the quality of the schedule from a makespan point-of-view.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new solution algorithm to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with activity splitting and setup times. The option of splitting activities, known as activity preemption, has been studied in literature from various angles, and an overview of the main contributions will be given. The solution algorithm makes use of a meta-heuristic search for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) using network transformations to split activities in subparts. More precisely, the project network is split up such that all possible preemptive parts are incorporated into an extended network as so-called activity segments, and setup times are incorporated between the different activity segments. Due to the inherent complexity to solve the problem for such huge project networks, a solution approach is proposed that selects the appropriate activity segments and ignores the remaining segments using a boolean satisfiability problem solver, and afterwards schedules these projects to near-optimality with the renewable resource constraints. The algorithm has been tested using a large computational experiment with five types of setup times. Moreover, an extension to the problem with overlaps between preemptive parts of activities has been proposed and it is shown that our algorithm can easily cope with this extension without changing it. Computational experiments show that activity preemption sometimes leads to makespan reductions without requiring a lot of splits in the activities. Moreover, is shown that the degree of these makespan reductions depends on the network and resource indicators of the project instance.},
