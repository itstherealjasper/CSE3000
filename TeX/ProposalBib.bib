   abstract = {The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Project (RCPSP), together with some of its extensions, has been widely studied. A fundamental assumption in this basic problem is that activities in progress are non-preemptable. Very little effort has been made to uncover the potential benefits of discrete activity pre-emption, and the papers dealing with this issue have reached the conclusion that it has little effect on project length when constant resource availability levels are defined. In this paper we show how three basic elements of many heuristics for the RCPSP – codification, serial SGS and double justification – can be adapted to deal with interruption. The paper is mainly focussed on problem 1_PRCPSP, a generalization of the RCPSP where a maximum of one interruption per activity is allowed. However, it is also shown how these three elements can be further adapted to deal with more general pre-emptive problems. Computational experiments on the standard j30 and j120 sets support the conclusion that pre-emption does help to decrease project length when compared to the no-interruption case. They also prove the usefulness of the justification in the presence of pre-emption. The justification is a RCPS technique that can be easily incorporated into a wide range of algorithms for the RCPSP, increasing their solution quality – maintaining the number of schedules calculated.},

   abstract = {The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a paradigmatic scheduling problem where the activities of a project have to be scheduled while respecting a combination of precedence and resource constraints. Precedence constraints are relations between two activities stating that one cannot start until the other has ended, and resource constraints bound the amount of resources used by activities running simultaneously. Many generalizations of the RCPSP have been proposed in the literature, including multiple execution modes for the activities (MRCPSP), or time varying resource availabilities and demands (RCPSP/t). In this work we present Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formulations to solve the RCPSP, as well as its two variants MRCPSP and RCPSP/t. Although it is really natural to formulate resource constraints of RCPSP-like problems using the linear integer arithmetic (LIA) theory, we show how, by exploiting the information provided by the precedence relations, we can obtain compact and efficient encodings of resource constraints to Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formulas. Using these SAT encodings instead of the LIA ones, turns to be crucial regarding efficiency. The method is adapted to encode resource constraints for the other two considered variants. In this adaptation, the method exploits not only precedences, but multiple execution modes or time varying resource availabilities and demands. Our experimental results show that the proposed encodings are more efficient than existing state-of-the-art exact solving techniques for the studied problems.},

   abstract = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time–cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations.},

   abstract = {This paper reports on a new solution approach for the well-known multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP). This problem type aims at the selection of a single activity mode from a set of available modes in order to construct a precedence and a (renewable and non-renewable) resource feasible project schedule with a minimal makespan. The problem type is known to be NP-hard and has been solved using various exact as well as (meta-)heuristic procedures. The new algorithm splits the problem type into a mode assignment and a single mode project scheduling step. The mode assignment step is solved by a satisfiability (SAT) problem solver and returns a feasible mode selection to the project scheduling step. The project scheduling step is solved using an efficient meta-heuristic procedure from literature to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). However, unlike many traditional meta-heuristic methods in literature to solve the MRCPSP, the new approach executes these two steps in one run, relying on a single priority list. Straightforward adaptations to the pure SAT solver by using pseudo boolean non-renewable resource constraints has led to a high quality solution approach in a reasonable computational time. Computational results show that the procedure can report similar or sometimes even better solutions than found by other procedures in literature, although it often requires a higher CPU time.},

It has become a well-known standard problem in the context of project scheduling which has attracted numerous researchers who developed both exact and heuristic scheduling procedures. However, it is a rather basic model with assumptions that are too restrictive for many practical applications. Consequently, various extensions of the basic RCPSP have been developed. This paper gives an overview over these extensions. The extensions are classified according to the structure of the RCPSP. We summarize generalizations of the activity concept, of the precedence relations and of the resource constraints. Alternative objectives and approaches for scheduling multiple projects are discussed as well.

   abstract = {We consider a sequencing problem that arises, for example, in the context of scheduling patients in particle therapy facilities for cancer treatment. A set of non-preemptive jobs needs to be scheduled, where each job requires two resources: (1) a common resource that is shared by all jobs and (2) a secondary resource, which is shared with only a subset of the other jobs. While the common resource is only required for a part of the job's processing time, the secondary resource is required for the whole duration. The objective is to minimize the makespan. First we show that the tackled problem is NP-hard and provide three different lower bounds for the makespan. These lower bounds are then exploited in a greedy construction heuristic and a novel exact anytime A⁎ algorithm, which uses an advanced diving mechanism based on Beam Search and Local Search to find good heuristic solutions early. For comparison we also provide a basic Constraint Programming model solved with the ILOG CP optimizer. An extensive experimental evaluation on two types of problem instances shows that the approach works even for large instances with up to 2000 jobs extremely well. It typically yields either optimal solutions or solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%.},

Precedence- and resource-constrained (project) scheduling problems are focused on, but similar ideas may be applied to other network optimization problems. A network construction procedure is described that takes into account: 1. constraints on the network topology, 2. a resource factor that reflects the density of the coefficient matrix, and 3. a resource strength, which measures the availability of resources. The strong impact of the chosen parametric characterization of the problems is shown via an in depth computational study. Instances for the single- and multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem are benchmarked by using the state of the art (branch and bound) procedures. The results provided demonstrate that the classical benchmark instances used by several researchers over decades belong to the subset of the very easy ones. In addition, it is shown that hard instances, being far smaller in size than presumed in the literature, may not be solved to optimality even within a large amount of computation time.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new solution approach to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem in the presence of three types of logical constraints. Apart from the traditional AND constraints with minimal time-lags, these precedences are extended to OR constraints and bidirectional (BI) relations. These logical constraints extend the set of relations between pairs of activities and make the RCPSP definition somewhat different from the traditional RCPSP research topics in literature. It is known that the RCPSP with AND constraints, and hence its extension to OR and BI constraints, is NP-hard. The new algorithm consists of a set of network transformation rules that removes the OR and BI logical constraints to transform them into AND constraints and hereby extends the set of activities to maintain the original logic. A satisfiability (SAT) solver is used to guarantee the original precedence logic and is embedded in a metaheuristic search to resource feasible schedules that respect both the limited renewable resource availability as well as the precedence logic. Computational results on two well-known datasets from literature show that the algorithm can compete with the multi-mode algorithms from literature when no logical constraints are taken into account. When the logical constraints are taken into account, the algorithm can report major reductions in the project makespan for most of the instances within a reasonable time.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new solution algorithm to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with activity splitting and setup times. The option of splitting activities, known as activity preemption, has been studied in literature from various angles, and an overview of the main contributions will be given. The solution algorithm makes use of a meta-heuristic search for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) using network transformations to split activities in subparts. More precisely, the project network is split up such that all possible preemptive parts are incorporated into an extended network as so-called activity segments, and setup times are incorporated between the different activity segments. Due to the inherent complexity to solve the problem for such huge project networks, a solution approach is proposed that selects the appropriate activity segments and ignores the remaining segments using a boolean satisfiability problem solver, and afterwards schedules these projects to near-optimality with the renewable resource constraints. The algorithm has been tested using a large computational experiment with five types of setup times. Moreover, an extension to the problem with overlaps between preemptive parts of activities has been proposed and it is shown that our algorithm can easily cope with this extension without changing it. Computational experiments show that activity preemption sometimes leads to makespan reductions without requiring a lot of splits in the activities. Moreover, is shown that the degree of these makespan reductions depends on the network and resource indicators of the project instance.},

   abstract = {The well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) schedules project activities within the precedence and renewable resource constraints while minimizing the total lead time of the project. The basic problem description assumes non-pre-emptive activities with fixed durations, and has been extended to various other assumptions in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the effect of three activity assumptions on the total lead time and the total resource utilization of a project. More precisely, we investigate the influence of variable activity durations under a fixed work content, the possibility of allowing activity pre-emption and the use of fast tracking to decrease a project’s duration. We give an overview of the procedures developed in the literature and present some modifications to an existing solution approach to cope with our activity assumptions under study. We present computational results on a generated dataset and evaluate the impact of all assumptions on the quality of the schedule.},
