In this problem, a fixed setup time is required to restart when an process is preempted. The project contains activities inter-related by finish to start type precedence relations with a time lag of zero, which require a set of renewable resources. The problem formed in this way is an NP-hard. A mixed integer programming model is proposed for the problem and a parameters tuned meta-heuristic namely genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it. To evaluate the validation and performance of the proposed algorithm a set of 100 test problems is used. Comparative statistical results show that the proposed algorithm is efficiently capable to solve the problem.},

   abstract = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time–cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations.},

   abstract = {This paper reports on a new solution approach for the well-known multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP). This problem type aims at the selection of a single activity mode from a set of available modes in order to construct a precedence and a (renewable and non-renewable) resource feasible project schedule with a minimal makespan. The problem type is known to be NP-hard and has been solved using various exact as well as (meta-)heuristic procedures. The new algorithm splits the problem type into a mode assignment and a single mode project scheduling step. The mode assignment step is solved by a satisfiability (SAT) problem solver and returns a feasible mode selection to the project scheduling step. The project scheduling step is solved using an efficient meta-heuristic procedure from literature to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). However, unlike many traditional meta-heuristic methods in literature to solve the MRCPSP, the new approach executes these two steps in one run, relying on a single priority list. Straightforward adaptations to the pure SAT solver by using pseudo boolean non-renewable resource constraints has led to a high quality solution approach in a reasonable computational time. Computational results show that the procedure can report similar or sometimes even better solutions than found by other procedures in literature, although it often requires a higher CPU time.},

Then we present the results of our thorough computational study for which standard sets of project instances have been used. The outcome reveals that our procedure is the most promising genetic algorithm to solve the RCPSP.

The execution of project activities may require the use of different types of resources (money, crews, equipment, …). The scheduling objectives may also take many forms (minimizing project duration, minimizing project costs, maximizing project revenues, optimizing due date performance,…).

We show that for this generalization the activity list and the activity set list representations can be used as efficiently as in the (RCPSP) and that by using these representations the optimal solution can always be reached. This allows most of the known solution procedures for (RCPSP) based on these representations to be extended for the generalized (RCPSP) by simply replacing the classical decoding procedure used for the (RCPSP) with the generalized version introduced here.},

Since the 1960s many optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve this NP-hard problem, and their performances are evaluated in well-known test problems with different complexities. Although it is desirable to find an algorithm which can provide promising solutions with reasonable computational efforts for any problem under consideration, no single algorithm can meet that condition. To deal with this challenge, we present a genetic algorithm based memetic algorithm (MA) for solving RCPSP. The algorithm is initiated by a critical path-based heuristic and a variant of the Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (NEH) heuristic. The algorithm involves a similar block order crossover and a variable insertion based local search. An automatic restart scheme is also presented which assists the algorithm to escape from local optima. In addition, a design-of-experiment (DOE) method is used to determine the set of suitable parameters for the proposed MA. Numerical results, statistical analysis and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Some of these methods provide excellent effectiveness and efficiency at the expense of being utterly complicated. In fact, several published methods require substantial implementation efforts, exploit problem specific speed-up techniques that cannot be applied to slight variations of the original problem, and often re-implementations of these methods by other researchers produce results that are quite different from the original ones. In this work we present a new iterated greedy algorithm that applies two phases iteratively, named destruction, were some jobs are eliminated from the incumbent solution, and construction, where the eliminated jobs are reinserted into the sequence using the well known NEH construction heuristic. Optionally, a local search can be applied after the construction phase. Our iterated greedy algorithm is both very simple to implement and, as shown by experimental results, highly effective when compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new solution algorithm to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with activity splitting and setup times. The option of splitting activities, known as activity preemption, has been studied in literature from various angles, and an overview of the main contributions will be given. The solution algorithm makes use of a meta-heuristic search for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) using network transformations to split activities in subparts. More precisely, the project network is split up such that all possible preemptive parts are incorporated into an extended network as so-called activity segments, and setup times are incorporated between the different activity segments. Due to the inherent complexity to solve the problem for such huge project networks, a solution approach is proposed that selects the appropriate activity segments and ignores the remaining segments using a boolean satisfiability problem solver, and afterwards schedules these projects to near-optimality with the renewable resource constraints. The algorithm has been tested using a large computational experiment with five types of setup times. Moreover, an extension to the problem with overlaps between preemptive parts of activities has been proposed and it is shown that our algorithm can easily cope with this extension without changing it. Computational experiments show that activity preemption sometimes leads to makespan reductions without requiring a lot of splits in the activities. Moreover, is shown that the degree of these makespan reductions depends on the network and resource indicators of the project instance.},
